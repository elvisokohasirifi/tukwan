The picturesque and undulating Kumasi is the regional capital, the second largest city in Ghana and is about 150 miles inland from the Gulf of Guinea. The Asantes (Ashantis) constitute the largest of the various subgroups of the Akan, who trace their origins partly to Bono-Manso and Techiman, in present-day Brong Ahafo Region. The Asante kingdom was founded by the great King Osei Tutu in the eighteenth century. His fetish priest, Okomfo Anokye unified the Asante states through allegiance to the Golden Stool, which miraculously descended from heaven. Okomfo Anokye planted two trees in the forest and predicted that one tree would live and become the capital of Ashanti. Hence, the name Kumasi (the tree that lived); the place in which the other tree was planted became Kumawu (the tree which died). The Ashanti tribe is one of the few matrilineal societies in West Africa. The Ashantis are most famous today for their craft work, particularly their hand-carved stools, fertility dolls and their colourful kente cloth. They are blessed with rich culture, and a home to pomp and pageantry. The region is also known for its historical and mythical landmarks. The main dishes of Ashantis include fufu with light soup, or “abunu abunu” (green soup) or palm nut soup, ampesi (plantain, yam, cassava, cocoyam). Adowa, Kete and Nwomkoro are the traditional dances of the Ashantis and the renowned one is the Adowa. The Adowa is performed by people dressed in fine apparel especially the kente cloth. It is danced at major events, ceremonies, festivals, funerals and so on. There are other tribes who have migrated from their regions and are dispersed all over the region. The Ashantis are known to be very hospitable, so they have designated areas to these tribes where one can find most of them and have a feel of their culture.", "");

He decided to build a fort like that occupied by his white friends in Cape Coast where he could live like the British Governor of Cape Coast. He more importantly admired the brown color of the granite used to build the castle in Cape Coast, so he made people carry head loads of granite from the Coast to Kumasi, molded them into bricks for the construction of the fort. However, it was mined and destroyed by Sir Garnet Wolseley’s expedition in 1873/74. After the arrest and deportation of Asantehene Prempeh I, the British saw the wisdom in the old fort and reconstructed it to the plans of Captain Phillips of the Royal Engineers and named King George’s Fort. The Museum was officially established in 1952 and it was then known as the Gold Coast Regimental Museum.

Approximately two hours drive west of Accra, Cape Coast, the capital of the Central Region is well prepared for your visit with classified accommodation and catering units, established tour operators, efficient transportation and a whole host of activities for you to enjoy. The Central Region was historically part of the Western Region until 1970 when it was carved out just before the 1970 Population Census. It occupies an area of 9,826 square kilometres or 4.1 per cent of Ghana’s land area, making it the third smallest in area after Greater Accra and Upper East. The region was the first to make contact with the Europeans. Its capital, Cape Coast, was also the capital of the Gold Coast until 1877, when the capital was moved to Accra. The region is predominantly Akan speaking (82.0%), followed by Guan (6.1%) and Ewe (4.8%). The Fantes, who are mainly along the coast, are the predominant group among the Akan (56.6%).", "");

In 1471, when a Don Diego d’ Azambuja led Portuguese expedition arrived, they referred to Elmina as “Mina de Ouro” meaning the gold mine because of the vast amount of gold and ivory they found.  Trading was imminent and Elmina became the centre of a thriving trade in gold, ivory and slaves which were exchanged for cloth, beads, brass bracelets etc. The Portuguese built the St. Georges Castle or Sao Jorge da Mina (now Elmina Castle) in 1482. The edifice covered an area of 97,000 sq ft becoming the earliest known European structure in the tropics. As trade buoyed, it attracted other Europeans and a struggle for control ensued. The Dutch eventually captured the castle and remained in its control for the next 235 years. On 6th April, 1872, the castle was ceded to the British.

Earlier, in 1674, the English had built a small fort, named Fort Charles, after the reigning monarch King Charles II. The English demolished Fort Charles in 1731, to prevent its capture and use by another European company - notably their archrival in overseas colonisation, the French.  The French, however, rebuilt a fort where Fort Charles once stood. Regretting the loss of their Anomabu fort, the English hastened to then build a new one - Fort William. The fort was probably christened Fort William by 19th century commander Brodie Cruickshank in honour of King William IV, upon the completion of another one storey apartment. Constructed almost entirely with local materials, Fort William is considered ‘one of the handsomest and best built of the Coast’ . However, ‘nowhere else does the original structure of a fort include a large prison specifically built to hold slaves awaiting transport overseas’ . Speaking about Anomabu slave exports, an English captain said in 1717, “[From] January 1702 to August 1708 they took to Barbados, Jamaica a total of not less than 30,141 slaves” .

Arent Groote persuaded the Ambro Braffo (Chief of the Fanti state) to sign exclusive trading rights to the British, who then proceeded to construct a lodge to coagulate their claim to the area. In 1640, the lodge was destroyed by fire. Believing the Dutch to be the arsons, a charge fervently denied, the British built a heavily fortified fort. The new fort had four bastions linked by thick walls, and a three storey apartment. In 1661, the Royal African Company obtained ownership of the fort, and it became the headquarters of English Gold Coast activities. Dutch Admiral Michiel Adriaensz De Ruyter captured the fort in 1665 after a ‘long and bloody battle’ . He reconstructed the fort and named it Fort Amsterdam.  In 1811, the people of Anomabu, who were English allies, attacked and destroyed the fort. It is believed that the first slave prison on the Gold Coast was in its hollow southeast bastion.

Fort Good Hope was initially a small triangular fort, shielded by three bastions and a curtain wall. An apartment building is shielded by the south curtain wall. Inter-ethnic wars between the Asante, Akyem and Akwamu ethnic groups, among others, led to such huge increases in prisoners-of-war slaves, that in 1715 the fort was expanded to include large male and female slave prisons.

The idea of Stingless Bees came up in 2003 when Prof. Kwapong visited Brasil where he first came into contact with stingless beekeeping. Back in Ghana, he carried out research which revealed that most of our forests are actually inhabited by stingless bees. Together with 3 of his graduate students then, Prof. Kwapong initiated the Stingless Bee Project within the catchment of the Kakum National Park. The project started by training twenty-five rural farmers selected from five communities around the National Park. By the end of 2006, about nine species of stingless bees had been identified; of which 4 are being cultured at the Center. The Ghana Heritage and Conservation Trust, an NGO in Ghana, donated a 20-acre parcel of a secondary tropical rain forest, bordering the Kakum National Park, to serve as a sanctuary for the stingless bees. An acre of the land was later developed into the International Stingless Bee Center which was intended as a research and service center for all stingless bee keepers to address their problems. Various species of stingless bees found throughout the country were collected and housed in artificial wooden hives at the center for culturing, research, management and development of their medicinal hive products. Through the benevolent funding from CS Fund for four continuous years, the project was transformed into the only International Stingless Bee Center in Africa. The center over the years has trained more than 200 Farmers, Beekeepers, Agricultural Extension Agents and Staff of Timber and Fruit Growing Companies throughout the 10 regions of Ghana. Some bee keepers from neighbouring West African countries have also received training in stingless beekeeping at the Center. At the moment, the Center has established five satellite stingless beekeeping stations within 5 communities in Ghana. The Center also attracts many foreign and local students including researchers and post doctoral research fellows for short term research collaborations. Since its inception, many of our local students from the University of Cape Coast have been carrying out research and practical lessons at the Center. The medicinal hive products of the stingless bees have caught the attention of the world due to their medicinal and health properties. This has enabled the center to engage in some core activities including Research, Training and Development, Hive Product Development and Marketing, Environmental Education and Ecotourism.
